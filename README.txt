BRIEF
=====

Code accompanying the paper: Tang, W., Shin, J. D. & Jadhav, S. P. (2023). Geometric transformation of cognitive maps for generalization across hippocampal-prefrontal circuits. Cell Reports.


GETTING STARTED
===============

Launch MATLAB and cd into the directory containing the code (e.g. '/Tang_CellRep_2023/').


Time-filter framework: Jadhav Lab (Brandeis University) and Frank Lab (UCSF)
Other files in the directory (with all sub-folders) needed in path for running the time-filter framework and other analysis:  
\usrlocal\   
\Src_Matlab\  
\Sleep_Code\

Toolboxes required:
- Libsvm (version 3.12; https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvm/) 

- Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) (version 4.1; https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/71902-uniform-manifold-approximation-and-projection-umap)

- MatPlotLib (version 2.1.3; https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/62729-matplotlib-perceptually-uniform-colormaps)


These codes were originally created in the MATLAB 2017a. All main scripts have plotting functions built-in to generate the figures shown in the paper.
